Project Planning:
First of all, of course you have to come up with an idea. For me, this was a project in itself. My planning process can definitely use some work as well. Anyhow, I wanted to work on the back-end of my project first to ensure my APIs were functioning as needed. I was not able to implement many of the things I set out to do in the front-end.
